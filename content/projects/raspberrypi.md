Early hands-on projects using Raspberry Pi for basic hardware and software integration.

Worked with Python, GPIO inputs/outputs and simple game mechanics. Built small interactive programs to interface with physical components.

Focused on understanding how software interacts with real hardware constraints.

* **Tech:** Python, GPIO, Linux environment.
* **Result:** Developed practical intuition for debugging hardware–software interactions.
