First-principles modelling of an impulse water turbine to maximise power extraction for a defined head–pressure curve.

Derived governing equations for jet velocity, bucket impulse transfer and rotational dynamics. Modelled nozzle geometry, bucket shape and gearbox ratios to identify optimal operating conditions under varying flow regimes.

Transient response simulated in Simulink to assess stability and startup behaviour.

* **Tech:** MATLAB, Simulink, analytical modelling.
* **Result:** Identified optimal geometric parameters and transmission ratios, improving predicted efficiency and validating against theoretical limits.
