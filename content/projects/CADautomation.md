</div>

Automation tooling to extract structured metadata from parametric CAD models and prepare assets for downstream digital integration.

Parsed geometry properties, part hierarchies and naming conventions to generate consistent identifiers and structured data outputs. Reduced manual processing required for documentation and 3D embedding workflows.

Designed for repeatability across multiple design iterations.

* **Tech:** Python, CAD APIs, data transformation scripts.
* **Result:** Significantly reduced manual engineering documentation time and improved consistency between design revisions.
