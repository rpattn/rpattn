Extended a first-year structural mechanics brief by developing a MATLAB GUI for truss analysis.

Users define nodal coordinates, member connectivity, cross-sectional limits and applied loads. The tool assembles global stiffness matrices, solves for nodal displacements and computes member stresses.

Visual output includes colour-coded stress states and utilisation ratios.

* **Tech:** MATLAB, matrix methods, GUI development.
* **Result:** Provided clear visual linkage between stiffness matrix formulation and physical stress behaviour.
