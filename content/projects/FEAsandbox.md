Browser-based playground for building 2D node-element structural models.

Users can define nodes, apply loads and boundary conditions, and visualise structural response. Intermediate stiffness matrices and system equations are surfaced to connect mathematical formulation to structural behaviour.

* **Tech:** TypeScript, Canvas API, linear algebra routines.
* **Result:** Educational tool bridging first-principles mechanics and computational implementation.
