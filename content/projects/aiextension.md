Extended a Python-based lifecycle and cost simulation tool to support structured API access and browser-based execution.

Refactored monolithic scripts into modular services. Exposed parameterised simulation runs through REST endpoints and implemented input validation to prevent invalid engineering cases.

Built a lightweight front-end interface to allow non-technical colleagues to run and compare scenarios without modifying source code.

* **Tech:** Python, FastAPI, Docker, TypeScript.
* **Result:** Increased internal adoption by removing scripting barriers and standardising simulation configuration.
