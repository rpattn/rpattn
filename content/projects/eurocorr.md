Extended a Masters research project investigating degradation behaviour in additively manufactured alloys.

Curated experimental datasets and trained supervised machine learning models to predict erosion–corrosion response under varying conditions. Analysed feature sensitivity to interpret material performance drivers.

* **Tech:** Python, scikit-learn, data preprocessing pipelines.
* **Result:** Co-authored paper presented at EuroCorr 2025 demonstrating how data-driven methods complement traditional materials engineering.
