Full-stack web application enabling non-technical users to run wind plant system design simulations using NREL system models.

Built a structured interface over complex engineering models (WOMBAT / ORBIT), transforming raw outputs into decision-ready KPIs, cost breakdowns and Gantt schedules.

* **Tech:** Python, TypeScript, React, Docker, REST APIs.
* **Result:** Reduced simulation setup time by ~80% for engineering consultants and standardised model execution workflows.
