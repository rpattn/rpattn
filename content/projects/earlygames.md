Developed small-scale games and physics simulations from first principles.

Built simple rendering loops, collision detection systems and state management logic in Java and Unity (C#). Recreated existing games, then extended them with additional mechanics to explore system design and optimisation.

Introduced early exposure to event-driven architecture and debugging complex interactive behaviour.

* **Tech:** Java, C#, Unity.
* **Result:** Built foundational understanding of system logic, rendering pipelines and performance constraints.
