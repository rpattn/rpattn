Finite element analysis of a Robinson R22 horizontal stabiliser under defined flight loading conditions.

Developed the model incrementally — beginning with simplified isotropic assumptions and progressing to layered composite definitions. Applied aerodynamic load cases and constrained boundary conditions representative of mounting interfaces.

Automated ply orientation optimisation using Python to evaluate stiffness, stress distribution and mass trade-offs.

* **Tech:** ANSYS, Python optimisation scripts.
* **Result:** Demonstrated improved structural response through automated layup optimisation while maintaining weight constraints.
