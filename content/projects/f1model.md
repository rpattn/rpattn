Independent vehicle performance modelling study estimating top speed, acceleration, braking distance and cornering limits using publicly available specifications.

Developed a longitudinal dynamics model incorporating aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, traction limits and gear ratio constraints. Extended the model in Simulink to capture transient gear-change behaviour and drivetrain torque interruption.

Compared steady-state and transient predictions to assess sensitivity to gear shift modelling.

* **Tech:** MATLAB, Simulink, vehicle dynamics modelling.
* **Result:** Improved prediction accuracy by modelling transient drivetrain effects; achieved additional academic credit for analytical depth.
